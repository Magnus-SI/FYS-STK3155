Plots showing the bias-variance tradeoff on the Franke function data with different data points and different methods.

The naming convention is given by:

methods_#datapoints_log10(lambda)_log10(noise)_compn(True/False)

The methods in the plot are written with initial letters only, e.g. OR -> OLS + Ridge, ORL -> OLS + Ridge + Lasso. compn is followed by False if compared to actual data, True if compared to noisy data
